## About

**The university of Helsinki, the guys behind mooc.fi, used to have a free
online course on the basics of web development with Java: **[**web-palvelinohjelmointi-21.mooc.fi/**](https://web-palvelinohjelmointi-21.mooc.fi/)** **

**While the course is good and provides lots of hands on exercises
(downloadable from mooc.fi's TestMyCode platform), it has a few issues:**

* **You might have noticed the "used to" in the first sentence. The course
  itself has been deprecated since 2021, while the technology keeps evolving.
  We are now at Spring 6 and Spring Boot 3 while the original course
  covers Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2**
* **The course is only available in finnish, while it is possible to do the
  original course with the help of Google Translate etc., it is still far
  from a perfect experience, eg "Stateless" was once translated to
  "Spaceless"**

## **What am I going to learn ?**

**Building web apps with Java and Spring Boot**

## **Prerequisites: What do I need to know to follow the course ?**

* **Basic Java knowledge eg from the first 12 chapters of**[** https://java-programming.mooc.fi/**](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)
* **Basis HTML, CSS and Javascript eg from ****one**** of**
  * **Freecodecamp: **[**www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)**  and **[**www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)****
  * **The Odin Project: **[**www.theodinproject.com/**](https://www.theodinproject.com/)****
* **Basics of HTTP (Client-Server model, HTTP methods and Status codes) eg from **[**developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)****
* **Basics of SQL eg from **[**sqlbolt.com/**](https://sqlbolt.com/)****
* **The very basics of Spring Boot eg from [the official tutorials](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)**

## **What do I need ?**

* **Access to a Unix based machine. If you are using Windows, look into WSL2. Mac should be fine**
* **A program to write code. I am using VS Code with the Java and Spring Boot Extension packs but feel to use whatever you want**
* **Java, at least version 17. You can use a tool like SDKMan if you need to manage different Java Versions**

## **What are we going to build ?**

**This course contains several smaller exercises, where you are provided
starter code and you have to implement an individual feature. The
starter code comes usually with tests, allowing you to check your
solutions. These exercises are independent of each other.**

**Besides those, there is a larger project, where you will build a social network
from scratch, one feature at time throughout the course. You will just
be told what the feature should do. The code, the design and the tests
have to not only implemented, but also designed by you.**
